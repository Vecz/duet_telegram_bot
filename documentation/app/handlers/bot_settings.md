## Documentation for `bot_settings.py`

### File Description

`bot_settings.py` contains handlers for commands and callback requests related to the bot's settings.

### Imports

- `from aiogram import F, Router, types`: Importing necessary classes and functions from the `aiogram` library for working with the Telegram API.

- `from aiogram.fsm.context import FSMContext`: Importing the Finite State Machine (FSM) context for managing user states.

- `from aiogram.types import Message, ReplyKeyboardRemove`: Importing message types and keyboard for replies.

- `from app.models import DBfunc, db`: Importing functions for working with the database.

- `from app.keys import make_keyboard, load_message`: Importing functions for creating keyboards and loading messages.

- `from app.states import CameraStates`: Importing states of the finite state machine.

- `from os import listdir`: Importing a function for working with the file system.

### Creating a Router

```python
router = Router()
```

Creating a `Router` object for handling requests.

### Initializing Functions and Objects

python

```python
dbFunc = DBfunc()
```

Initializing the `DBfunc` object for working with the database.

### Callback Handler `settings_menu`

python

```python
@router.callback_query(F.data == "settings")
async def settings_menu(callback: types.CallbackQuery, state: FSMContext):
    # ... code handling ...
```

This callback handler is triggered when the "Settings" button is pressed in the menu.

1.  `callback`: Callback query object.
    
2.  `state`: Finite State Machine context for managing user states.
    

### Callback Handler `settings_menu` (in state `CameraStates.Settings` and when "Language" button is pressed)

python

```python
@router.callback_query(CameraStates.Settings, F.data == "lang")
async def settings_menu(callback: types.CallbackQuery, state: FSMContext):
    # ... code handling ...
```

This callback handler is triggered when the "Language" button is pressed in the settings menu, when the user is in the `CameraStates.Settings` state.

1.  `callback`: Callback query object.
    
2.  `state`: Finite State Machine context for managing user states.
    

### Text Message Handler (in state `CameraStates.Locale` and when the text length is 2 characters)

python

```python
@router.message(CameraStates.Locale, F.text.len() == 2)
async def settings_menu(message: Message, state: FSMContext):
    # ... code handling ...
```

This handler is triggered when a text message with a length of 2 characters is received, while the user is in the `CameraStates.Locale` state.

1.  `message`: Text message object.
    
2.  `state`: Finite State Machine context for managing user states.
    

### General Comments

*   The code uses asynchronous functions to efficiently handle multiple requests simultaneously.
    
*   Each handler is provided with a brief description, specifying input parameters and the logic of operation.
    
*   States are used to control the bot's behavior depending on the current context.
