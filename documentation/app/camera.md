## Documentation for `camera.py`

### File Description

`camera.py` is a module responsible for capturing frames from a camera, processing them into a timelapse video, and managing the files.

### Imports

- `import aiohttp`: Imports the aiohttp library for making asynchronous HTTP requests.

- `from PIL import Image, ImageFile`: Imports classes from the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image processing.

- `import cv2`: Imports the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.

- `import io`: Imports the io module for handling binary data.

- `import numpy as np`: Imports the NumPy library for numerical computations.

- `import time`: Imports the time module for working with time-related tasks.

- `import logging`: Imports the logging module for generating log messages.

- `import asyncio`: Imports the asyncio library for asynchronous programming.

- `from app.models import db, DBfunc, Filefunc`: Imports database-related classes from the `models.py` module.

- `from config.config import FPS, WANTED_TIME, VIDEO_DIR, W, H`: Imports constants related to video capture.

- `from app.compress_video import compress_video`: Imports a function for compressing videos.

- `import os`: Imports the os module for interacting with the operating system.

### Function `get_time_format()`

```python
def get_time_format():
    # ... code ...
```
This function returns a formatted string representing the current date and time.

### Coroutine async def capture(bot)
```python
async def capture(bot):
    # ... code ...
```
This coroutine captures frames from a camera and processes them into a timelapse video.

- `bot`: The bot instance.
### The coroutine performs the following steps:

- Waits for 2 seconds to allow initialization.

- Enters an infinite loop.

- Attempts to establish a connection to the printer.

- Retrieves information about the printer's state.

- Calculates the time remaining for printing.

- Checks if the printer is in a "processing" state. If not, raises an exception.

- Extracts relevant information from the printer response.

- Starts capturing frames to create a timelapse video.

- Writes frames to a video file.

- Manages video files (compression, renaming, deletion).

- Adds the video file to the database.

- If an error occurs, logs a message and waits for 5 seconds.
